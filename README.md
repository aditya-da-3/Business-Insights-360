## Key Insights

#### 1) Finance View

- Net sales experienced a significant YOY increase, with peak demand consistently observed in **November and December**, driven by global festive seasons.

- March 2020 sales fell below the previous year, likely impacted by **COVID-1**9, while in 2022, net sales nearly **achieved** the target, missing by a narrow margin of just **1.5%**.

- While net sales increased YOY, a **decline** in net profit highlights AtliQ's growth phase as it focuses on establishing its global market identity.

- The gross margin, which dropped in 2020 due to COVID-19, showed significant **recovery** by 2022, indicating that AtliQ is expanding its market share while steadily **improving profitability**.

#### 2) Sales View

- A consistent **60:40 ratio** between **Total COGS** and **Gross Margin** was observed across all fiscal years for AtliQ Hardware.

- Amazon, AtliQ Exclusive, and AtliQ e-Store led in net sales across all regions and fiscal years; however, in 2022, Amazon and AtliQ e-Store fell short of the Gross Margin % target.

- A GM % target tolerance of 10% highlights regions and customers where AtliQ Hardware missed the target by a significant margin.

- In 2022, key focus markets include the Philippines, Germany, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Portugal, as they fell way below the **10% GM %** tolerance threshold.

- **The Desktop segment**, absent in 2019, showcased massive growth over the years in Net Profit % and Gross Margin %.

- **The Networking segment** consistently topped Net Profit % across all fiscal years.

- **Keyboards and Laptops** emerged as the most sold categories over the years.

#### 4) Supply Chain View

- **The Accessories segment** faced consistent stock shortages over the years, highlighting high demand and frequent shortages of keyboards, while **the Desktop segment** experienced excess inventory, likely due to higher laptop production.

- Over the 4-year period, **November and December** recorded the highest net errors, whether due to excess inventory or stockouts, reflecting fluctuating demand during these months.

- Forecast accuracy dropped from **86% to 72%** in mid-2020 due to COVID-19, with a steady recovery observed by 2022.
