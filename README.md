- To Create a Interactive Dashboard using  Power BI to fulfill AtliQ‚Äôs Business needs.

- Enable quick insights for businesses across markets by Building A 360¬∞ Dashboard which provides Insights About Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain & Executive View All Together .

## Key Insights

#### 1) GoodCabs generates 70% of its revenue from tourists and 30% from business commuters.

#### 2) Peak demand in Feb, April, May is due to festivals, holidays, and vacations, while Jan and June face low demand from post-holiday slowdown and monsoon.

#### 3) Passengers with higher repeat trip counts take 2-3 trips, and business cities have more trips on weekdays than weekends, while tourism cities see the opposite trend.

#### 4) Jaipur outperforming all other cities in trips, revenue, ratings, and targets.
However, it faces challenges with repeat passenger rates and new passenger targets **(-15%)**, indicating:
   - Low passenger loyalty
   - Insufficient tailored marketing
   - This pattern is common across Tourism-focused cities
   - Jaipur's strong performance is largely driven by its tourist attraction.

#### 5) Surat, a business hub, has the highest repeat passenger rate (50%) due to lower trip costs and frequent business travel needs.
  However, it struggles with:
  - Achieving trip and ratings targets
  - Lowest passenger and driver ratings
  - This trend is common in business-focused cities and highlights service quality issues.
    
## Recommendations

- GoodCabs should focus on tailored marketing and brand awareness by offering free trips after 5 successful referrals to boost both brand visibility and passenger loyalty.

- GoodCabs should enhance service quality and offer perks to drivers, especially in business hubs like Surat and Vadodara.

- GoodCabs should actively collect customer reviews and implement feedback quickly to improve customer satisfaction.

- GoodCabs should run targeted campaigns and partner with established brands in tourist spots to increase reach, offering lower trip costs or profit sharing.

- GoodCabs should implement EVs and urban technology in business hubs to reduce operating costs, where profits are lower due to shorter trip distances and lower fares.
